Bearing wheels and caster wheels play a crucial role in industrial and
commercial applications by ensuring smooth movement and load-bearing
efficiency. This report presents an in-depth analysis of the design,
selection, and performance of these components while considering
real-world constraints. The study explores key factors such as material
properties, mechanical performance, environmental effects, and safety
regulations.

In this project, AISI 1045 steel was selected for the shaft due to its
high strength and durability, while AISI 52100 chrome steel was chosen
for the bearings due to its superior hardness and wear resistance. These
materials were evaluated based on their ability to withstand dynamic
loads, environmental exposure, and operational stress. Various
constraints, including manufacturing limitations, mechanical durability,
and safety considerations, were addressed to optimize performance and
ensure compliance with ISO 3691-4:2020 standards.

The methodology involved theoretical calculations and finite element
analysis (FEA) to validate design choices. Calculations for shaft
diameter, bearing life, and stress distribution were conducted to
confirm that the selected materials could endure the specified load
conditions. Additionally, the rolling friction and torque requirements
were assessed to enhance efficiency and operational reliability.

The findings indicate that the proposed design meets industry
requirements, offering a balance between performance,
cost-effectiveness, and durability. By integrating proper lubrication
strategies and protective coatings, the longevity of these components
can be further improved. Future work may involve experimental validation
through real-world testing and the exploration of sustainable materials
to enhance environmental compliance.

This study provides valuable insights into the systematic design and
analysis of bearing and caster wheels, ensuring that they function
optimally in industrial applications. The research emphasizes the
importance of selecting appropriate materials, adhering to safety
standards, and considering real-world constraints to achieve

\section{CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION}\label{chapter-one-introduction}

Bearing wheels and caster wheels are integral components in various
industrial and commercial applications, facilitating mobility, load
distribution, and operational efficiency. These wheels are commonly
found in material handling equipment, automotive systems, and heavy
machinery, where they ensure seamless movement and reduced friction. The
efficiency and durability of these components directly impact
productivity, safety, and cost-effectiveness in different industries.

Designing an effective bearing or caster wheel system involves several
critical factors, including material selection, load-bearing capacity,
resistance to environmental conditions, and compliance with industry
standards such as ISO 3691-4:2020. Material properties play a vital role
in determining the strength, wear resistance, and overall performance of
the wheels. Common materials used in bearing wheels include AISI 1045
steel for shafts and AISI 52100 chrome steel for bearings, both of which
offer high durability and load-handling capabilities.

The study of bearing and caster wheels also involves analyzing
mechanical constraints, including torque requirements, frictional
forces, and stress distribution. Ensuring optimal performance requires
comprehensive calculations, including shaft diameter determination,
bearing life assessment, and stress-strain analysis. Additionally,
environmental considerations such as exposure to moisture, temperature
variations, and corrosive elements influence the selection of materials
and protective coatings.

Manufacturing constraints must also be addressed to maintain
cost-effectiveness and efficiency in production. Precision machining,
heat treatment processes, and surface finishing techniques are necessary
to achieve the desired durability and performance characteristics.
Furthermore, safety factors such as load limitations, stability, and
braking mechanisms must be considered to prevent operational hazards and
equipment failure.

This project aims to develop a systematic approach to designing and
evaluating bearing and caster wheels while addressing real-world
challenges. By integrating theoretical calculations with finite element
analysis (FEA), this study seeks to enhance the reliability, efficiency,
and sustainability of these components. The findings will contribute to
improving material selection, optimizing load distribution, and ensuring
compliance with industry regulations, ultimately leading to more robust
and long-lasting wheel systems.

\section{CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE
REVIEW}\label{chapter-two-literature-review}

Research on bearing wheels and caster wheels has extensively explored
their mechanical properties, material composition, and industrial
applications. Several studies have emphasized the significance of
material selection in determining the durability and efficiency of these
components. According to Smith et al. (2020), AISI 1045 steel is widely
used for shaft manufacturing due to its high tensile strength and
resistance to mechanical fatigue. Similarly, AISI 52100 chrome steel is
preferred for bearings due to its excellent hardness, wear resistance,
and ability to withstand high loads.

Lubrication and friction management play crucial roles in ensuring the
longevity of bearing systems. Studies by Brown and Pietra (2018)
highlight that improper lubrication can lead to increased friction,
wear, and premature failure of bearings. Advanced lubrication
techniques, such as sealed bearings and self-lubricating materials, have
been explored to enhance performance and minimize maintenance
requirements.

The impact of environmental factors on bearing and caster wheel
performance has also been a key area of research. According to Can and
Ozkarahan (2019), exposure to high humidity and extreme temperatures can
accelerate corrosion and degrade material integrity. Protective
coatings, such as zinc plating and polymer encapsulation, have been
recommended to improve resistance against environmental hazards.

Manufacturing techniques and precision engineering have further
influenced the development of high-performance bearing and caster
wheels. Recent advancements in computer-aided design (CAD) and finite
element analysis (FEA) have enabled engineers to optimize designs for
maximum efficiency. Studies by Johnson et al. (2021) indicate that
simulation-based testing allows for accurate prediction of load
distribution, stress concentrations, and potential failure points,
leading to more reliable designs.

Safety considerations in wheel design have also been extensively
analyzed. Research by Lee and Kim (2022) emphasizes the importance of
braking mechanisms and stability enhancements in caster wheel
applications, particularly in medical and industrial equipment. Proper
weight distribution and impact resistance are essential factors in
preventing accidents and improving operational safety.

In conclusion, the literature underscores the importance of material
selection, lubrication, environmental protection, and advanced
manufacturing techniques in optimizing bearing and caster wheel
performance. The integration of modern engineering tools and industry
standards ensures that these components meet the growing demands of
industrial applications while maintaining safety, durability, and
efficiency. This study builds upon existing research to develop a
comprehensive approach to designing and evaluating bearing and caster
wheel systems.

\section{CHAPTER THREE: REALISTIC
CONSTRAINTS}\label{chapter-three-realistic-constraints}

\subsection{3.1 Material Constraints}\label{material-constraints}

Bearing wheels and caster wheels require high-strength materials for
load-bearing capacity and durability. AISI 1045 steel is chosen for the
shaft due to its excellent mechanical properties, including high yield
strength (530 MPa) and good machinability. AISI 52100 chrome steel is
used for bearings due to its superior hardness and wear resistance.
However, these materials are susceptible to corrosion in humid
environments, necessitating protective coatings or stainless
alternatives. The choice of rubber or polyurethane for the wheel itself
impacts rolling resistance, wear rate, and temperature resistance.

\subsection{3.2 Manufacturing
Constraints}\label{manufacturing-constraints}

Manufacturing challenges include precision machining of shafts and
bearings to ensure proper tolerances. Heat treatment processes are
required for AISI 52100 bearings to achieve the necessary hardness.
Forging and casting limitations impact cost and production scalability.
Bearings must meet ISO 3691-4:2020 standards, which impose strict
requirements on tolerances and material integrity. The availability of
raw materials and manufacturing costs also influence design decisions.

\subsection{3.3 Mechanical Constraints}\label{mechanical-constraints}

Bearing wheels and caster wheels must withstand dynamic loads and
impacts without failure. Bearings must be designed to handle radial and
axial loads efficiently. Torque calculations ensure that the system
operates within safe stress limits. Misalignment and excessive vibration
can reduce bearing life, requiring proper lubrication and mounting
techniques. The wheel\textquotesingle s rolling friction, influenced by
surface conditions and load distribution, impacts efficiency.

\subsection{3.4 Environmental
Constraints}\label{environmental-constraints}

Environmental factors such as temperature variations, moisture, and
chemical exposure affect material performance. Bearings exposed to
extreme temperatures may experience reduced lubrication effectiveness,
leading to higher friction and wear. Caster wheels used in outdoor
environments must resist UV degradation and corrosion. Sustainable
material choices and waste reduction strategies are essential to meet
environmental regulations.

\subsection{3.5 Safety Constraints}\label{safety-constraints}

Safety considerations include ensuring that the wheels can withstand
maximum load without failure. Overloading can lead to bearing fatigue
and catastrophic failure. Proper braking mechanisms must be integrated
into caster wheel systems to prevent uncontrolled movement. Bearings
must comply with safety standards such as ISO 3691-4:2020 to prevent
accidents due to bearing failure. Ergonomic considerations also play a
role in reducing strain on operators handling heavy loads.

\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{3.3 Number of Balls in the

To determine the diameter of the balls in the bearing when we are
supposed to have 9 balls( i tried all the number less than 9 , they were
not compatible with the standard), we can use the following formula:

\(z = \pi(D + d)/2db\)

where:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  z is the number of balls.
\item
  D is the outer diameter of the bearing.
\item
  d is the inner diameter of the bearing.
\item
  db is the diameter of each ball.
\end{itemize}

Given:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  z=9
\item
  D = 32 mm
\item
  d = 12 mm
\end{itemize}

We need to solve for db:

9=π(32+12)/2db

9=π×44/2db

db=22π/9

db≈7.68 mm

\begin{itemize}

through experimental testing and field applications. Additionally, the
integration of smart sensors for real-time load monitoring and
predictive maintenance could enhance operational efficiency and extend
the service life of the components. Sustainable material alternatives
should also be explored to align with environmental regulations and
industry trends toward eco-friendly solutions.

In conclusion, this project successfully demonstrated a structured
